  # Smart Scan reviews your code change using OpenAI and decides if a CodeQL scan is needed. 
  # 
  # Smart Scan is looking for any changes to the source code that could impact your application 
  # functionality.  With this action introduced, CodeQL scans will be skipped for minor changes 
  # to the repository such as markdown file edits, Actions edits, and comments being added to 
  # your application source code.
  # 
  # Smart Scan will only skip CodeQL checks during the PR.  Merges to Main ALWAYS get scanned
